Step-by-Step Simulation for 4-Queens Problem Using Backtracking

Board Representation:
- board[row] = col means a queen is placed at (row, col).

Start Backtracking...

Step 1: Place Queen in Row 0
- Try column 0 → safe ✅
  Board: [0, -1, -1, -1]
- Recurse to row 1

Step 2: Row 1
- Try column 0 → ❌ (same column as row 0)
- Try column 1 → ❌ (diagonal conflict with row 0)
- Try column 2 → ✅
  Board: [0, 2, -1, -1]
- Recurse to row 2

Step 3: Row 2
- Try column 0 → ❌ (same column as row 0)
- Try column 1 → ❌ (diagonal conflict with row 1)
- Try column 2 → ❌ (same column as row 1)
- Try column 3 → ❌ (diagonal conflict with row 1)
No valid column → Backtrack

Backtrack to Row 1
- Reset column, try next column in row 1
- Try column 3 → ❌ (diagonal conflict with row 0)
No valid position → Backtrack

Backtrack to Row 0
- Try column 1 → ✅
  Board: [1, -1, -1, -1]
- Recurse to row 1

Step 4: Row 1
- Try column 0 → ❌ (diagonal conflict with row 0)
- Try column 1 → ❌ (same column)
- Try column 2 → ❌ (diagonal)
- Try column 3 → ✅
  Board: [1, 3, -1, -1]
- Recurse to row 2

Step 5: Row 2
- Try column 0 → ✅
  Board: [1, 3, 0, -1]
- Recurse to row 3

Step 6: Row 3
- Try column 0 → ❌ (same as row 2)
- Try column 1 → ❌ (diagonal with row 2)
- Try column 2 → ✅
  Board: [1, 3, 0, 2]
All queens placed! 🎉
