1. Characteristics of Cloud:
- On-Demand Self-Service: Users can access resources when needed without human interaction.
- Broad Network Access: Services are available over the internet and accessible from anywhere.
- Resource Pooling: Resources are shared among multiple users dynamically.
- Rapid Elasticity: Resources can be scaled up or down easily.
- Measured Service: Resource usage is monitored, controlled, and reported.

2. What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet such as storage, processing power, databases, and software.

Components:
- Front-End (Client devices)
- Back-End (Servers, storage, applications)
- Cloud Infrastructure
- Internet Network

(Diagram not drawable here, but it includes client devices connecting via internet to cloud servers hosting applications and storage)

3. Characteristics of Cloud Computing:
(Same as Q1)

Advantages:
- Cost-effective
- Scalable
- Accessible from anywhere
- Maintenance-free for user

Disadvantages:
- Internet dependency
- Security risks
- Limited control for users

4. Cloud Service Models:
- SaaS (Software as a Service): Delivers software applications over the internet (e.g. Gmail, MS Office 365)
- PaaS (Platform as a Service): Provides platform to develop, run, and manage apps (e.g. Google App Engine)
- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Provides virtualized computing resources (e.g. AWS EC2)

Cloud Deployment Models:
- Public Cloud
- Private Cloud
- Hybrid Cloud
- Community Cloud

(Diagram typically shows user interacting with these service models and deployment types)

5. Programming Environment of Google App Engine:
Google App Engine supports multiple languages like Python, Java, Go. It provides APIs, a development server, and cloud storage. Developers can deploy apps without managing servers.

6. Security Issues in Cloud:
- Data Breaches
- Loss of data
- Account Hijacking
- Insecure APIs
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Insider threats

7. General Architecture of HDFS:
Includes:
- NameNode: Manages metadata and namespace
- DataNode: Stores actual data blocks
- Client: Interacts with HDFS

(Diagram shows NameNode connected to multiple DataNodes and clients)

8. General Architecture of GFS:
Includes:
- Master: Maintains metadata
- Chunkservers: Stores data in chunks
- Clients: Interact via master to access chunkservers

9. Disaster Recovery:
It is a strategy to restore IT systems after failures due to disasters.

Threats:
- Natural disasters
- Hardware failures
- Cyber attacks
- Power outages

10. ZigBee Technology:
A low-power wireless communication standard used in IoT for short-range data transmission, commonly used in home automation and smart devices.

11. Implementation Levels of Virtualization:
- Hardware-level
- OS-level
- Application-level
- Storage Virtualization
- Network Virtualization

12. Need for Virtualization:
- Efficient resource utilization
- Isolation of applications
- Cost savings
- Easier backups and recovery

Advantages:
- Scalability
- Flexibility
- Disaster recovery
- Reduced hardware cost
