Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Overview
------------------------------------
A Minimum Spanning Tree is a subset of edges in a connected, weighted, undirected graph that:
- Connects all the vertices.
- Has no cycles.
- Has the minimum possible total edge weight.

Two common algorithms for finding the MST:
- Kruskal's Algorithm
- Prim's Algorithm

------------------------------------
Kruskal's Algorithm (Greedy Approach)
------------------------------------
Definition:
Kruskal’s Algorithm builds the MST by selecting edges in increasing order of weight,
ensuring that no cycle is formed.

Key Concepts:
- Greedy Algorithm: Picks the minimum weight edge that doesn’t cause a cycle.
- Disjoint Set (Union-Find): Checks for cycles.

Algorithm Steps:
1. Sort all edges in non-decreasing order of their weights.
2. Initialize an empty MST set.
3. For each edge (u, v) in sorted order:
   - If find(u) != find(v): (i.e., no cycle is formed)
     - Add edge to MST.
     - Union the sets of u and v.
4. Stop when MST has V - 1 edges.

Time Complexity:
- O(E log E) for sorting + union-find.

Space Complexity:
- O(V + E)

Use Case:
- Best for sparse graphs.

------------------------------------
Prim’s Algorithm (Greedy Approach)
------------------------------------
Definition:
Prim’s Algorithm builds the MST by growing a single tree, choosing the smallest edge
connecting a vertex inside the MST to one outside.

Key Concepts:
- Greedy selection of the minimum weight edge.
- Uses Priority Queue (Min-Heap).

Algorithm Steps:
1. Start with any vertex.
2. Use a min-heap to store edges.
3. While the heap is not empty:
   - Extract the smallest edge.
   - If the vertex is not visited:
     - Add to MST.
     - Push all adjacent edges to the heap.
4. Repeat until all vertices are included.

Time Complexity:
- O(E log V) using binary heap and adjacency list.

Space Complexity:
- O(V + E)

Use Case:
- Best for dense graphs.

Summary
------------------------------------
- Both are Greedy algorithms for finding MST.
- Kruskal’s adds lightest edge without forming a cycle (using Union-Find).
- Prim’s grows MST from a node, always adding the nearest neighbor.
- Use Kruskal for sparse graphs and Prim for dense graphs.
