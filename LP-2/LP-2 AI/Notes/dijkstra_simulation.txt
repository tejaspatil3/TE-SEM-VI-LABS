Starting node: 'A'

Step 1: Start at node 'A':
- Current Node: 'A'
- Distances: {A: 0, B: ∞, C: ∞, D: ∞, E: ∞, F: ∞}
- Neighbors of 'A': B (4), C (5)
  - Distance to 'B': 0 + 4 = 4, update distances[B] = 4, previous[B] = A
  - Distance to 'C': 0 + 5 = 5, update distances[C] = 5, previous[C] = A

Updated Distances: {A: 0, B: 4, C: 5, D: ∞, E: ∞, F: ∞}
Updated Previous: {A: None, B: A, C: A, D: None, E: None, F: None}

---

Step 2: Move to the next closest node (node 'B' with distance 4):
- Current Node: 'B'
- Distances: {A: 0, B: 4, C: 5, D: ∞, E: ∞, F: ∞}
- Neighbors of 'B': A (4), C (11), D (9), E (7)
  - Distance to 'A': 4 + 4 = 8, but 8 > distances[A] = 0, no update
  - Distance to 'C': 4 + 11 = 15, but 15 > distances[C] = 5, no update
  - Distance to 'D': 4 + 9 = 13, update distances[D] = 13, previous[D] = B
  - Distance to 'E': 4 + 7 = 11, update distances[E] = 11, previous[E] = B

Updated Distances: {A: 0, B: 4, C: 5, D: 13, E: 11, F: ∞}
Updated Previous: {A: None, B: A, C: A, D: B, E: B, F: None}

Step 3: Move to the next closest node (node 'C' with distance 5):
- Current Node: 'C'
- Distances: {A: 0, B: 4, C: 5, D: 13, E: 11, F: ∞}
- Neighbors of 'C': A (5), B (11), E (3)
  - Distance to 'A': 5 + 5 = 10, but 10 > distances[A] = 0, no update
  - Distance to 'B': 5 + 11 = 16, but 16 > distances[B] = 4, no update
  - Distance to 'E': 5 + 3 = 8, update distances[E] = 8, previous[E] = C

Updated Distances: {A: 0, B: 4, C: 5, D: 13, E: 8, F: ∞}
Updated Previous: {A: None, B: A, C: A, D: B, E: C, F: None}

Step 4: Move to the next closest node (node 'E' with distance 8):
- Current Node: 'E'
- Distances: {A: 0, B: 4, C: 5, D: 13, E: 8, F: ∞}
- Neighbors of 'E': B (7), C (3), F (6)
  - Distance to 'B': 8 + 7 = 15, but 15 > distances[B] = 4, no update
  - Distance to 'C': 8 + 3 = 11, but 11 > distances[C] = 5, no update
  - Distance to 'F': 8 + 6 = 14, update distances[F] = 14, previous[F] = E

Updated Distances: {A: 0, B: 4, C: 5, D: 13, E: 8, F: 14}
Updated Previous: {A: None, B: A, C: A, D: B, E: C, F: E}

Step 5: Move to the next closest node (node 'D' with distance 13):
- Current Node: 'D'
- Distances: {A: 0, B: 4, C: 5, D: 13, E: 8, F: 14}
- Neighbors of 'D': B (9), F (2)
  - Distance to 'B': 13 + 9 = 22, but 22 > distances[B] = 4, no update
  - Distance to 'F': 13 + 2 = 15, but 15 > distances[F] = 14, no update

Updated Distances: {A: 0, B: 4, C: 5, D: 13, E: 8, F: 14}
Updated Previous: {A: None, B: A, C: A, D: B, E: C, F: E}

Step 6: Move to the next closest node (node 'F' with distance 14):
- Current Node: 'F'
- Distances: {A: 0, B: 4, C: 5, D: 13, E: 8, F: 14}
- Neighbors of 'F': D (2), E (6)
  - Distance to 'D': 14 + 2 = 16, but 16 > distances[D] = 13, no update
  - Distance to 'E': 14 + 6 = 20, but 20 > distances[E] = 8, no update

Updated Distances: {A: 0, B: 4, C: 5, D: 13, E: 8, F: 14}
Updated Previous: {A: None, B: A, C: A, D: B, E: C, F: E}
