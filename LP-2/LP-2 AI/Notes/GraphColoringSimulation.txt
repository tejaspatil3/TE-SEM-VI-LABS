Graph Coloring using Backtracking Algorithm
-------------------------------------------------

Theory:
-------
Graph coloring is a way of coloring the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
The goal is to find a valid coloring using at most 'm' different colors.

This problem is NP-Complete, meaning there's no known polynomial-time solution.
Hence, we use backtracking to try all combinations of vertex coloring.

Algorithm Steps:
1. Start from the first vertex.
2. Try assigning each color (from 0 to m-1) to the vertex.
3. For each color, check if assigning it is safe (i.e., no adjacent vertex has the same color).
4. If safe, assign the color and move to the next vertex recursively.
5. If at any point, no color can be assigned, backtrack to the previous vertex and try the next color.
6. If all vertices are assigned colors successfully, we have a solution.

Simulation:
-----------
Graph:
0 -- 1
|  / |
2 -- 3

Number of colors: 3 (0=Red, 1=Green, 2=Blue)

Step-by-step coloring:
Vertex 0: Try color 0 -> Safe => Assign Red
Vertex 1: Try color 0 -> Not Safe
          Try color 1 -> Safe => Assign Green
Vertex 2: Try color 0 -> Not Safe
          Try color 1 -> Not Safe
          Try color 2 -> Safe => Assign Blue
Vertex 3: Try color 0 -> Safe => Assign Red

Final Solution:
---------------
Vertex 0 -> Color 0 (Red)
Vertex 1 -> Color 1 (Green)
Vertex 2 -> Color 2 (Blue)
Vertex 3 -> Color 0 (Red)
