### Prim's Algorithm Explanation

In Prim's algorithm, we aim to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, weighted, undirected graph.
We do this by starting with an arbitrary node, and then iteratively adding the shortest edge that connects a 
new node to the already selected nodes until all nodes are included.

**Steps in the code:**
1. We initialize the `selected` list to track which nodes are included in the MST. Initially, we mark the first node as selected (i.e., node 0).
2. We initialize `total_weight` to 0, which will store the total weight of the MST.
3. The outer loop runs `num_nodes - 1` times because an MST with `num_nodes` vertices always has `num_nodes - 1` edges.
4. Inside the outer loop:
    - We find the smallest edge connecting a selected node to an unselected node by checking all edges.
    - We update the `min_weight` and store the nodes `x` and `y` that form this edge.
    - The edge with the smallest weight is then added to the MST by printing it and adding its weight to the total weight.
    - The node `y` is marked as selected.
5. After the loop finishes, the total weight of the MST is printed.

### Simulation

Graph Representation:
The graph is represented as a 2D adjacency matrix where `graph[i][j]` gives the weight of the edge between node `i` and node `j`.
A weight of 0 means there is no edge between the nodes.

Example graph (9 nodes):
graph = [
    [0, 0, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Node 0
    [0, 0, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Node 1
    [3, 6, 0, 0, 7, 2, 0, 0, 0],  # Node 2
    [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0],  # Node 3
    [0, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],  # Node 4
    [0, 0, 2, 8, 0, 0, 3, 6, 0],  # Node 5
    [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 3, 0, 5, 7],  # Node 6
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 5, 0, 4],  # Node 7
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 0]   # Node 8
]

### Iteration by Iteration Explanation
**Initial Setup:**
- `selected = [True, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False]`
- `total_weight = 0`

**First Iteration:**
- Start from node 0 (selected).
- Check edges from node 0 to other unselected nodes.
- The minimum edge is (0, 2) with weight 3.
- Update `selected[2] = True`, and add edge (0 - 2) with weight 3.
- `total_weight = 3`

**Second Iteration:**
- Now, nodes 0 and 2 are selected.
- Check edges from nodes 0 and 2 to unselected nodes.
- The minimum edge is (2, 5) with weight 2.
- Update `selected[5] = True`, and add edge (2 - 5) with weight 2.
- `total_weight = 5`

**Third Iteration:**
- Now, nodes 0, 2, and 5 are selected.
- Check edges from nodes 0, 2, and 5 to unselected nodes.
- The minimum edge is (2, 3) with weight 5.
- Update `selected[3] = True`, and add edge (2 - 3) with weight 5.
- `total_weight = 10`

**Fourth Iteration:**
- Now, nodes 0, 2, 5, and 3 are selected.
- Check edges from nodes 0, 2, 3, and 5 to unselected nodes.
- The minimum edge is (3, 6) with weight 4.
- Update `selected[6] = True`, and add edge (3 - 6) with weight 4.
- `total_weight = 14`

**Fifth Iteration:**
- Now, nodes 0, 2, 5, 3, and 6 are selected.
- Check edges from nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, and 6 to unselected nodes.
- The minimum edge is (6, 4) with weight 1.
- Update `selected[4] = True`, and add edge (6 - 4) with weight 1.
- `total_weight = 15`

**Sixth Iteration:**
- Now, nodes 0, 2, 5, 3, 6, and 4 are selected.
- Check edges from nodes 0, 2, 5, 3, 6, and 4 to unselected nodes.
- The minimum edge is (4, 7) with weight 0.
- Update `selected[7] = True`, and add edge (4 - 7) with weight 0.
- `total_weight = 15`

**Final Output:**
Edges in the MST:
0 - 2  3
2 - 5  2
2 - 3  5
3 - 6  4
6 - 4  1
4 - 7  0
Total weight of MST: 15
